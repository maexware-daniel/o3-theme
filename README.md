> - The target should be `source/out/o3-theme/`, not `source/out/` directly

#### Step 3: Install Build Tools

**3.1 Install Node.js & npm**

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

**Other Systems:**  
Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

## 3. Development

All source files for CSS and JavaScript are located in the `build/` directory.

### Available Commands

Run these commands from the theme root directory:

| Command | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `gulp` | Production build | Minified JS/CSS with PurgeCSS |
| `gulp dev` | Development watcher | Auto-rebuild on changes + TMP cleanup |

### Development Workflow

**Start the watcher:**
```bash
gulp dev
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Disable **Production Mode** in OXID Admin during development to keep source maps and unminified assets.
>
> Master Data â†’ Basic Settings â†’ Basic â†’ Production mode â†’ Off

The watcher monitors:
- `build/js/**/*.js` â†’ Rebuilds JavaScript bundles
- `build/scss/**/*.scss` â†’ Rebuilds CSS
- `**/*.tpl` â†’ Clears OXID TMP directory
- `Application/translations/**/*.php` â†’ Clears OXID TMP directory

**Production build:**
```bash
gulp
```

This will:
- Minify JavaScript and CSS
- Remove unused CSS with PurgeCSS
- Optimize assets for production

### PurgeCSS Safelist

PurgeCSS removes unused CSS classes. If you dynamically generate class names in JavaScript or templates, add them to the safelist.

**Example dynamic classes:**
```smarty
{* Template with dynamic class *}
<div class="[{$type}]-view"></div>
```

**Add to safelist in `gulpfile.js`:**
```javascript
safelist: [
    'grid-view',    // Add your dynamic classes here
    'line-view',
    /^custom-/,        // Or use patterns
]
```

**Location:** Line ~81 in `gulpfile.js` in the PurgeCSS configuration.

## 5. Asset Integration

### JavaScript
- Main JS bundle:   
  ``<DOCUMENT_ROOT>/source/Application/views/o3-theme/build/js/main.bundle.js``
- ``import`` new scripts here to include them in the **main JS**.
- Files in `build/js/widgets/` are standalone and must be explicitly loaded in templates:
  ``[{oxscript include="js/widgets/checkagb.js" priority=10}]``
> JavaScript from modules can also be integrated into ``main.bundle.js``. Descriptions and examples can be found in the bundle-file.

### SCSS


- Main SCSS bundle:  
  ``<DOCUMENT_ROOT>/source/Application/views/o3-theme/build/scss/main.bundle.scss``
- ``@import`` new styles here to include them globally.

> CSS/SCSS from the modules can also be integrated into ``main.bundle.scss``. Descriptions and examples can be found in the bundle-file.

---

## 6. jQuery

- This theme uses Bootstrap 5.3.8, which means that vanilla JS is used instead of jQuery.
- If jQuery is absolutely necessary, enable it in theme settings (same version as theme wave).
- Deprecation warnings during build are harmless and will disappear when updating Bootstrap.


## 7. Compatibility with PayPal
The PayPal module checks the active theme ID in one of its templates:
``[{if $oViewConf->getActiveTheme()=='flow'}]`` 
Change ``'flow'`` to ``'o3-theme'`` for compatibility.
